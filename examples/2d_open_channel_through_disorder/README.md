# Open Channel Through Disorder

In this example, we show how to use mesti2s() to compute the transmission matrix of a strongly scattering disordered medium, analyze the transmission matrix to determine an incident wavefront that can penetrate the disorder with almost 100% transmission (called an "open channel"), and then use mesti2s() again to compute the field profile of the open channel while comparing to that of a typical plane-wave input.
